config.yaml
# Keep config.yaml if it's a template, but usually secrets are here. 
# Since it only has model names, maybe keep it? 
# The user didn't specify, but standard practice is to ignore config if it might have keys.
# However, this config.yaml seems harmless (model names). 
# I will NOT ignore config.yaml for now as it's needed for the app to run and doesn't seem to have secrets.
# If it had API keys, I would ignore it.
